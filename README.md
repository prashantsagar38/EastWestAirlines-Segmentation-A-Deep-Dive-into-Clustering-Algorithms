# EastWestAirlines-Segmentation-A-Deep-Dive-into-Clustering-Algorithms
To understand flying patterns and the usage of frequent flyer programs for East-West Airlines Co using Clustering Algorithms

# Implementing Clustering Algorithms:
* Implement the K-Means, hierarchical, and DBSCAN algorithms using a programming language such as Python with libraries like scikit-learn or MATLAB.
* Apply each clustering algorithm to the pre-processed dataset to identify clusters within the data.
* Experiment with different parameter settings for hierarchical clustering (e.g., linkage criteria), K-means (Elbow curve for different K values) and DBSCAN (e.g., epsilon, minPts) and evaluate the clustering results.

# Cluster Analysis and Interpretation:
* Analyse the clusters generated by each clustering algorithm and interpret the characteristics of each cluster. Write you insights in few comments.

# Visualization:
* Visualize the clustering results using scatter plots or other suitable visualization techniques.
* Plot the clusters with different colours to visualize the separation of data points belonging to different clusters.

# Evaluation and Performance Metrics:
* Evaluate the quality of clustering using internal evaluation metrics such as silhouette score for K-Means and DBSCAN.
